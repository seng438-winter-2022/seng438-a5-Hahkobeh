# Introduction
In this assignment we have analyzed test data through the use of reliability testing software. We first used a reliability growth assessment tool, C-SFRAT, in order to apply covariate software reliability models in order to select guide models for our data.

Next we created a reliability demonstration chard in order to check whether the mean time to failure was met.
